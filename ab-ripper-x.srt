REACH UP NICE AND TALL.
AUDRA'S GOT HER HANDS ON THE FLOOR,

37
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,687
这符合她的运动量
THAT WORKS FINE FOR HER.

38
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,055
接着做――25
THERE YOU GO--25.

39
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,689
接下来是“自行车运动”
WE GOT BICYCLES.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,192
我坐下，不多说了。
I'M ON MY BUTT,I'M DONE INSTRUCTING.

41
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,694
我们先向前蹬腿
WE'RE GONNA GO FORWARD FIRST.

42
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,195
我的手放在地上
I'VE GOT MY HANDS ON THE FLOOR.

43
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,199
开始了――1,2,3，
HERE WE GO--ONE, TWO, THREE,

44
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,203
4,5,6,7，

00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,705

47
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:52,211
11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16--

48
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,716
<i>灼烧感</i>
<i>IT BURNS-- 17, 18,19, 20,</i>

49
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,218
<i>21, 22--</i>
<i>GOING TO 25.</i>

50
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,821
23, 24, 25.

51
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,222
换方向，开始了，
AND REVERSE,HERE WE GO.

52
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,724
不要做错方向
WE'RE NOT GONNA MESS AROUND.

53
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,725
5, 4,
3,2――GO 继续

54
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,727
1，2――我起来
ONE, TWO--I'M UP.

55
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,228
3, 4--

56
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,231
他们来数数，不要停下来。
THEY'RE GONNA COUNT,KEEP MOVING.

57
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,733
漂亮的直线，胸挺直，
NICE STRAIGHT LINE HERE,CHEST IS UP.

58
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,735
转的圈很大。
BIG CIRCLES.

59
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,737
需要的话，双手可以支地
SUPPORT WITH YOUR HANDS IF YOU NEED TO.

60
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,240
詹森，他棒极了，简直是这里的王者。
JASON, HE'S THE KING,HE'S THE RIP KING.

61
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,243
双手高举来保持平衡
HANDS ARE HIGH FOR THE BALANCE,

62
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,244
更多的付出
A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK.

63
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,246
让我骄傲，干的漂亮
MAKES ME HAPPY,NICE.

64
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,747
不错
LOOKING GOOD.

65
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,751
19, 20,
21, 22,

66
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,821
23, 24 AND 25.

67
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,757
开始“蛙展”
TIME FOR CRUNCHY FROG.

68
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,259
大家把手都抬起来
EVERYBODY GETS THEIR HANDS OFF THE FLOOR!

69
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,761
开始了
HERE WE GO.

70
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,763
手臂张开，伸展
ARMS ARE OUT,I WANNA SEE 'EM SPREAD.

71
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,765
5, 4, 3,
2, AND--

72
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,767
内收 张开
WRAP AND OPEN.

73
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,271
2, 3, 4,
5, 6--

74
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,773
这是我们的节奏
HERE'S OUR PACE.

75
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,775
7,8――你如需要休息――
SEVEN, EIGHT--YOU NEED BREAKS--

76
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,778
9, 10--那就休息
9, 10--YOU BETTER TAKE 'EM.

77
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,279
挺胸
12-- GET YOUR CHEST UP.

78
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,782
13--你可以这样做，看到没？
YOU CAN DO THIS,YOU SEE THIS?

79
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,784
调整一下
GATHER YOURSELF.

80
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,786
管他的，我在调整，你也可以
HECK, I'M DOING IT,YOU CAN DO IT, TOO.

81
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,789
准备好了就回到运动中来
THEN YOU JUMP BACK IN WHEN YOU'RE READY.

82
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,792
不分第一部分或者第二部分
THERE AIN'T NO PART ONE AND PART TWO.

83
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,293
<i>这就算第二部分了，最后一个。</i>
<i>IT'S PART TWO, LAST ONE.</i>

84
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,798
我们开始做“盘腿仰卧起坐”
WE GOT CROSS LEG, ALL RIGHT?WIDE LEG SIT-UPS.

85
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,300
有两种方式
SO TWO VERSIONS.

86
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,304
盘腿 或者 伸直腿
CROSS LEG OR WIDE LEG.

87
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,805
伸直腿是简单做法
THIS ONE'S EASIER.

88
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,807
准备好了吗？大家躺下
ARE YOU READY?EVERYBODY BACK.

89
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,811
左手托头，起身转体
LEFT HAND BEHIND THE HEAD, REACH UP AND OVER.

90
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,815
5, 4, 3, 2-- 右手触摸左脚尖
UP, TOUCH YOUR TOE.

91
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,817
如你看到的，开始换手
YOU CAN SEE NOW,SWITCH HANDS.

92
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,320
哦，触摸脚尖，然后躺下
OH, TOUCH THE TOE,COME ON BACK.

93
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,823
起身，注意，要先高举手臂，然后再转体
UP, LOOK, I'M REACHING UP AND THEN OVER.

94
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,324
演示一下错误动作
WHAT I'M NOT DOING IS THIS,

95
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,827
不举手，直接触摸脚尖是错误的。
I'M NOT GOING STRAIGHT AND HERE.

96
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,831
应该高举手，再转体触摸
I'M GOING STRAIGHT UP AND OVER.

97
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,332
很好，接下来，换手
OKAY, AND THEN SWITCH THE HANDS.

98
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,836
高举 然后 转体
UP AND OVER...

99
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,338
高举 然后 转体
UP AND OVER.

100
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,841
注意看，这样做的话，强度更大
NOW, LOOK, THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER,

101
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,843
因为你不能借助腿部的力量
YOU CAN'T USE THE WEIGHT OF YOUR LEGS.

102
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,345
奥德利亚 向上伸展，然后转体
AUDRA'S GOING UP AND CROSSING OVER.

103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,847
换另一边
OTHER SIDE.

104
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,850
高举，然后，转体...持续不断
UP AND OVER... ALL DAY LONG.

105
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,353
很好，詹森，漂亮，我的兄弟
GOOD, JASON,NICE, MY BROTHER.

106
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,856
加油，12个了
COME UP.THAT'S 12.

107
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,858
我们还要做一会，一共25个
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE AWHILE.IT'S 25 REPS.

108
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,361
你需要休息，就休息。
YOU NEED A BREAK,TAKE THE BREAK.

109
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,365
很好，现在......
GOOD, NOW...

110
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,368
看看他，看看他，高高伸展然后向下触摸。
LOOK AT HIM, LOOK AT HIM.REACH, WAY UP AND THEN DOWN.

111
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,870
漂亮。注意，他的下巴一直没有触碰到胸
NICE. LOOK, HIS CHIN'S OFF HIS CHEST THE WHOLE TIME,

112
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,872
没有用下巴借力
HE'S NOT TUCKING HIS CHIN IN.

113
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,373
干净利落
GOOD CLEAN FORM.

114
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,876
这是核心动作，不仅是克朗琴动作
THIS IS CORE, THIS IS NOT JUST CRUNCHES, OKAY?

115
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,879
这是重要时刻，这是“腹肌撕裂者”明白？
THIS IS BIG-TIME,"AB RIPPER X," OKAY?

116
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,881
很好
NICE.

117
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,383
我要跟这些孩子们一起完成
I'M GONNA FINISH UP WITH THE KIDS.

118
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,886
开始
HERE WE GO.

119
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,888
向上转体......
AND UP...

120
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,890
我要盘腿做
I'LL EVEN CROSS MY LEGS.

121
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,893
高高伸展，向下触摸
AND UP AND DOWN...

122
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,396
伸展 触摸
AND UP AND DOWN...

123
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,400
伸展 触摸
AND UP AND DOWN...

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,803
再做一个玩玩，高高伸展，向下触摸
ONE MORE FOR FUN,AND REACH UP AND DOWN.

125
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,871
<i>好了，下面是“剪刀腿”</i>
<i>OKAY, TIME FOR FIFER SCISSORS.</i>

126
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,374
两点注意：抬高腿
TWO TIPS:FLEX YOUR FEET

127
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,875
然后尽可能的伸直腿
AND STRAIGHTEN YOUR LEGSTHE BEST YOU CAN.

128
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,378
大家躺下，双手放在体侧
EVERYBODY DOWN, HANDS ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO YOUR BODY.

129
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,381
踢出左腿，离地2.5厘米
KICK THE LEFT LEG OUT,INCH OFF THE FLOOR.

130
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,383
右腿尽可能的抬高
RIGHT LEG UP AS HIGH AS YOU CAN.

131
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,385
像剪刀，明白了？
SCISSOR, GET IT?

132
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,887
听到我喊数才可以换腿
CHANGE WHEN YOU HEARTHE NUMBER ONLY!

133
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,389
5, 4, 3, 2--

134
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,891
1...

135
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,394
2...

136
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,395
3--

137
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,897
没听到数字，不要换腿
DON'T CHANGE WITHOUT THE NUMBER.

138
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,400
4...

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,902
5...

140
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,405
6...

141
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,908
7--大家 现在 呼吸
BREATHE PEOPLE, NOW!

142
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,911
<i>8...</i>

143
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,414
9-- 我知道我们做的很慢
I KNOW,WE'RE TAKING OUR TIME.

144
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,416
10-你以为我要喊11了
YOU THINK I'M GONNA SAY 11.

145
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,418
11--

146
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,420
来看看大家做得怎么样
LET'S CHECK ONEVERYBODY.

147
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,423
12-- 很好，奥德利亚
GOOD, AUDRA.

148
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,426
13-- 向她一样的绷直脚尖――14――
KICK THE TOE THAT WAY

149
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,428
脚尖像她一样
FIGHT THE TOE THIS WAY.

150
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,930
15--抬腿
FLEX THE FEET.

151
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,933
16!

152
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,936
换腿
AND SWITCH.

153
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,939
18-- 等待我喊数字
WAIT 'TILYOU HEAR THE NUMBER.

154
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,442
19-- 他正努力地伸直腿
HE'S WORKING TO STRAIGHTEN THAT LEG.

155
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,944
20了，很好
THERE'S 20, GOOD.

156
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,948
21--踢到我的手，很好
HIT MY HAND, GOOD.

157
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,951
22--踢到我的手
HIT MY HAND.

158
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,952

00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,454
23--这就对了
THAT'S THE GRUNTIN'!

160
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,456
很好，24
GOOD, 24.

161
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,457
就这样，詹森，努力
THAT'S IT,JASON, WORK.

162
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,460
加油，再来一个
COME ON AGAIN,ONE MORE.

163
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,461
看到没，这才是锻炼的样子
SEE, THAT BOY IS WORKING.

164
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,095
这就是我想让你们做的
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE YOU DO.

165
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,965
很好，我们已经做了一半了，
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HALFWAY ALREADY, MAN,

166
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,468
趴体就要结束了，扫兴啊
PARTY'S ALMOST OVER,WHAT A BUMMER!

167
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,471
<i>好了，你需要休息，尽管休息</i>
<i>ALL RIGHT, IF YOU NEED A BREAK, TAKE 'EM!</i>

168
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,972
<i>我们要做25个</i>
<i>WE'RE DOING 25 A POP.</i>

169
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,977
<i>我们要做“高举”</i>
<i>WE GOT HIP ROCK 'N RAISE.</i>

170
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,478
<i>脚并拢</i>
<i>FEET ARE TOGETHER.</i>

171
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,980
大腿小腿间的距离
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE UPPER LEGS AND THE LOWER LEGS

172
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,983
要保持一致。手放这里。
STAYS THE SAME.HANDS ARE HERE.

173
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,985
当我的腿举到一半高度时，脚尖朝向正上方。
WHEN I REACH THE HALFWAY POINT MY TOES GO SKYWARD,

174
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,486
我们姿势要漂亮
LET'S MAKE IT PRETTY.

175
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,987
5, 4,3, 2--

176
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,991
上举，一个
UP, THAT'S ONE...

177
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,995
2...3--不可以比我快
DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME.

178
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,998
4――高高举起 缓缓放下
FOUR-- IT'S UP AND THEN IT'S DOWN.

179
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,500
5――高高举起 缓缓放下
FIVE-- IT'S UP,THEN IT'S DOWN.

180
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,003
6...7--

181
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,006
<i>保持膝盖张开</i>
<i>KEEP THOSE KNEES WIDE.</i>

182
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,010

183
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,513
10--别这么做（注意错误演示）
DON'T DO THIS.

184
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,516
11-- 看到我的错误演示了吗
YOU SEE WHAT I'M DOING HERE?

185
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,018
12--这样是不对的
THIS IS WRONG.

186
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,521
13--这样的话谁不能做 
ANYBODY CAN DO THIS.

187
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,524
14-- 这样才有锻炼效果
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS!

188
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,026
15――高高举起!
15-- GET 'EM UP!

189
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,030
16――这叫做“腹肌撕裂者 X”
16-- IT'S CALLED"AB RIPPER X."

190
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,534
17... 18...

191
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:53,539
19... 20-- 你需要休息，就休息
YOU NEED THAT BREAK, TAKE IT.

192
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,041
1--还剩四个
YOU GOT FOUR MORE.

193
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,544
2――我知道有灼烧感
<i>TWO-- I KNOW IT BURNS!</i>

194
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:03,549

25.

196
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,554
正当你觉得这些运动就够好了的时候
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS GORGEOUS ENOUGH,

197
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,056
我们要做“跳冲”，或者是“飞天脚”
WE'RE GONNA DO PULSE UP, OR HEELS TO THE HEAVENS--

198
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,058
你想叫它什么都行
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

199
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,562
现在 抬腿 全抬起来 绷直
NOW LEGS ARE UP,TOGETHER, STRAIGHT.

200
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,063
现在，也许你腿伸不直
NOW, SOME OF YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

201
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,566
你可以稍稍弯曲，但是我要你慢慢努力锻炼
YOU CAN BEND IT, BUT I WANT YOU TO FIGHT OVER TIME

202
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,067
争取能绷直
TO STRAIGHTEN THOSE LEGS.

203
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,070
脚跟朝上 脚尖向下压
HEEL UP, TOES DOWN.

204
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,072
伸直的 而不是冲这个方向
STRAIGHT UP,NOT THIS WAY.

205
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,573
开始
HERE WE GO.

206
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:33,078
1, 2, 3,

216
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,100

334
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,584
或者你可以从内膝盖处抓一次
OR YOU START ON THE INSIDE AND REACH UP AND DO ONE GRAB.

335
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,087
你可以抓四次
YOU CAN DO FOUR GRABS.

336
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,089
我不管 只要碰到腿就行
I DON'T CARE, JUST GET UP YOUR LEG.

337
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,591
抓的次数越少 就越难
THE LESS GRABS THE HARDER IT IS.

338
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,393
很好 再来一次
GOOD, ONE MORE TIME.

339
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,096
换 ...... 另一边
SWITCH...OTHER SIDE.

00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,104
退绷直 保持稳定
KEEP THE LEG STRAIGHT,KEEP IT ON ONE PLANE,

343
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,605
别乱晃
DON'T LET IT MOVE AROUND.

344
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,107
这是个不抓的
HERE'S A NO-GRAB.

345
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,609
4--起来
REACHING UP.

346
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,112
不抓 只触摸
NO GRAB, JUST TOUCHING.

347
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,614
这是抓两次的 就这样
HERE'S A TWO-GRAB,THERE YOU GO.

348
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,117
<i>在膝盖和脚趾处抓两下</i>
<i>TWO-GRAB AT THE KNEEAND THE TOE.</i>

349
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,119
<i>怎样有趣怎么做</i>
<i>MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR YOURSELF.</i>

350
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,121
<i>感觉怎么样</i>
<i>HOW DO YA FEEL THAT DAY?</i>

351
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,622
<i>用尽全力</i>
<i>DO WHAT YA CAN.</i>

352
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,626
<i>越少抓腿 就越难</i>
<i>THE LESS GRABS THE HARDER IT IS.</i>

353
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,128
脚后跟越内收 就越难
THE FURTHER THIS HEEL IS IN, THE HARDER IT IS.

354
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,130
很好 再来一次
NICE, ONE MORE TIME.

355
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,632
<i>然后...... 起来</i>
<i>AND... COME ON UP.</i>

356
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,500
哦 干得很漂亮
OH, VERY NICE.

357
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,134
我们就要强势结尾了
NOW WE'RE GONNA FINISH UP STRONG.

358
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,637
我不敢相信就快结束了 让我很难过
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ALMOST OVER, MAKES ME SAD.

359
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,139

用拳头 双手交叉 握拳
BRING THE FIST, THE HANDS TOGETHER, CLASP THE HANDS.

361
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,144
你每次都需要和地板接触到
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE CONTACT WITH THE FLOOR EVERY TIME.

362
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,646
腿抬起来 从右边开始
GET THE LEGS UP, WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE RIGHT FIRST.

363
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,148
40次

364
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,150
做越多越好 我们要做40个
DO AS MANY AS YOU CAN, WE'RE DOING 40.

365
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,152

00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,721
大家伙放松一下
LET'S DO A LITTLE STRETCH EVERYBODY.

390
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,222
我们做一下“上犬式”
LET'S DO A LITTLE UPWARD DOG.

391
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,725
保护一下胃部 来吧 开始
LET'S TAKE CARE OF OUR STOMACH. COME ON, HERE WE GO.

392
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,227
趴在你的瑜伽垫上
GET ON YOUR MATS.

393
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,730
你想做“眼镜蛇式”效果也是一样的
YOU CAN DO COBRA, TOO,HERE, IF YOU WANT.

394
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,732
就这样
THAT'S IT.

395
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,734
上犬式腹部、腿最好离开地面（力量弱的学员,部分大腿以及小腿也可以不离地,但是要求大腿前部提起）,脚趾背面着力,大腿内旋,臀部收缩并将耻骨向肚脐方向用力,尾骨向耻骨方向压.

UPWARD DOG,KNEES ON.

396

眼镜蛇式下腹部、骨盆、大腿、小腿都落在地上,脚趾不着力,脚背落地,大腿内侧肌肉向下旋转
COBRA, KNEES DOWN.

00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,239
记住这句话
REMEMBER,TIP OF THE DAY:

399
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,741
不要每天做 不需要
DON'T DO THIS EVERY DAY,YOU DON'T NEED IT.

400
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,244
你不每天锻炼别的部位 
YOU DON'T WORK OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY EVERY DAY,

401
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,745
腹肌也不应该每天锻炼
AND YOU SHOULDN'T WORK ABS EVERY DAY,

402
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,247
尤其是“腹肌撕裂者X”
ESPECIALLY"AB RIPPER X."

403
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,750
来做一下“婴儿式”
LET'S ALL GO INTO CHILD'S POSE.

404

译者注：新手应适当延长放松瑜伽时间，注意腿部的抻拉。

405
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,258
<i>他们要保持动作，我要说:</i>
<i>THEY'RE GONNA STAY THERE AND I'M GONNA SAY...</i>

406
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,759
<i>干的漂亮</i>
<i>NICE WORK.</i>

407
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,762
若果这是你当天最后一个健身运动
IF THAT'S YOUR LAST WORKOUT OF THE DAY

408
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,764
没有比现在更适合喝“恢复饮料”的时候了（蛋白质冲剂）
IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR YOUR RECOVERY DRINK.

409
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,766
